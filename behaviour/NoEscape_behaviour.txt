DATA_HANDLING:
- sir, your silence will only worsen the situation. after the publication of the data that we have, your company will have very big problems, because lawsuits, proceedings and compensation will cause you devastating damage.
you can avoid all these problems by starting negotiations with us.
otherwise, we will soon publish a press release on our data leak blog and the whole world will know that your company’s servers have been compromised.
- more than 50gb of confidential and sensitive data was stolen from your network.
if you do not negotiate with us, all data will be published on our data leak blog
